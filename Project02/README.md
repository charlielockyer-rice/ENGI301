This is my design of a PCB for an Etch-A-Sketch that runs off of a PocketBeagle.  I've included a sub-folder that houses all the Eagle files (the schematic, board, library, and design rules) called "Eagle files" to more easily access them.  I've also added a PDF of the schematic and a BOM.  Lastly, I've included gerber files for manufacturing in a sub-folder called "mfg".
